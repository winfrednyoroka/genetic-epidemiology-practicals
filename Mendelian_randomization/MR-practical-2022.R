#Example: MR study of the effect of body mass index on coronary heart  disease                                              
#################################################################################################
# Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death and morbidity in the world. Of the known risk factors, body mass index (BMI) is one of the most important. In prospective observational studies (Wormser et al Lancet 2011 377:1085), each standard deviation (SD) (~4.56 kg/m2) increase in BMI is associated with a relative risk of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17â€“1.29) for coronary heart disease (CHD), after adjustment for conventional vascular risk factors, including smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, and blood pressure. However, whether the association reflects a causal effect of BMI on CHD is unknown.

# 1: Define a genetic instrument for BMI 
# We've taken GWAS hits for BMI from the GIANT consortium, specifically the Locke Nature 2015 paper doi: 10.1038/nature14177. We defined GWAS hits as SNP-bmi associations with Pvalue<5x10^-8 (this is a conventional threshold for statistical significance in GWAS)

#3: Harmonise the CHD and BMI datasets              

# We harmonise the CHD and BMI datasets so that the effect alleles are the same

# First, we harmonise the datasets manually

# The effect alleles are apprently different but the SNP is also palindromic. This creates an ambiguity, in that the effect alleles could be the same but just coded using different strands. How can we resolve the ambiguity? The effect allele frequencies are very different. One is 0.32 and other is 0.67. It's clear from effect allele frequency that the effect alleles are different. We therefore need to flip the effect direction for this SNP in the outcome dataset

# Third effect allele discrepancy.

se_fixed_effect_ivw 
res[res$method == "Inverse variance weighted (fixed effects)",c("b","se") ]


# We could also estimated the IVW fixed effect by meta-analysis of the Wald ratios
wr<-dat$beta.outcome/dat$beta.exposure #estimate the wald ratios
wr.se<-dat$se.outcome/dat$beta.exposure #standard errors for Wald ratios (this is equivalent to first order term of delta method and a limitation is that it doesn't take into account uncertainty in SNP exposure effect)

# IVW fixed effect:
beta_fixed_effect<-sum(wr*1/wr.se^2)/sum(1/wr.se^2) 
# standard error for IVW fixed effect:
se_fixed_effect<-sqrt(sum(1/wr.se^2)^-1)
#notice this is the same result as produced by IVW fixed effect method in mr() function:
res[res$method == "Inverse variance weighted (fixed effects)",c("b","se") ]


# notice that the fixed and multiplicative random effect IVW models estimate the same effect size but the standard error from the random effects model is larger. The standard error in the random effects model incorporates the residual standard error in the linear regression model. The residual standard error represents heterogeneity between the SNPs, which potentially reflects horizontal pleiotropy. Note that the result from random effects IVW is valid if any horizontal pleiotropy is "balanced". 

#MR Egger 
# this is linear regression without the intercept constrained to pass through zero (in contast to random and fixed effects IVW, which assume a zero intercept)

# unlike the IVW methods, we must further harmonise the exposure and outcome summary data so that the effect allele always reflects the exposure increasing allele.

#results interpretation 
#################################################################


# 	Do you think BMI causes CHD? Split into 3 groups and discuss. One individual from each group will present a summary of the discussion to the class. Consider these questions in your discussion:
# a.	What is the odds ratio for coronary heart disease per unit increase in genetically elevated BMI? 
# b.	Is there evidence for pleiotropy or violations of MR assumptions? 
# c.	Are the genetic and observational effects directionally similar? Are they comparable? Note: In prospective observational studies, the multivariate adjusted relative risk for coronary heart disease per standard deviation higher BMI is 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17â€“1.29) (Wormser et al Lancet 2011 377:1085). 
# d.	Are these results compatible with a causal effect of BMI on coronary heart disease?
# e.	Can you think of reasons for caution?

# Also consider these assumptions and limitations of Mendelian randomization in your interpretation of the results: 

# Core assumptions of Mendelian randomization: 
# 1) The instrument is associated with the exposure
# 2) The instrument is not associated with confounders of the exposure-outcome association
# 3) The instrument is associated with the outcome exclusively via its effect on the exposure (also known as the exclusion restriction assumption)

# Other assumptions and limitations
# 1)	Samples should be independent 
# 2)	Two samples should be from the same population 
# 3)	Potential impact of weak instruments bias 
# 4)	Potential impact of winnerâ€™s curse, whereby the effects of the SNPs on BMI may be overestimated in the discovery stage of the GWAS 
# 5)	Strand ambiguity (when two GWAS studies use different reference strands)
# 6)	SNPs should be independent
